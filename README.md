# effective-broccoli
challenge 2, portfolio site

This was an interesting and fun project to work on. althrough frustrating at times, It allowed me to really reinforce concepts that I initally understood. While allowing me to problem solve how to implement other features I wanted to include.

In this project you will find the page is responsive to resizing with a screen break at 1200px. With this Media Query, I included some Javascript to allow for a collapsed menu bar. 


I hope you enjoy :)
